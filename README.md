### 📝 About Me:

- 🤙 Olá, I'm **André Ribeiro**, a Portuguese Scrum Master and Software Engineer based in the beautiful and sunny city of Lisbon, Portugal. 🇵🇹
- 💻 I've more than 10 years of experience developing software products, mainly using the .NET framework and Agile Methodologies (Scrum, Kanban, Extreme Programming, SAFe).
- 📑 I began my career as a Full-Stack Software Developer and Researcher, then progressed to a Tech Lead role, and later transitioned into Scrum Master/Agile Delivery Lead/Agile Coach.
- 🤓 Throughout my career, I learned from and mentored professionals in several software projects, both in the industry (Procurement, e-Governance, Telecommunications, Fintech, Food & Beverage) and academia (INESC-ID, Instituto Superior Técnico).
- 👀 I'm interested in Full-Stack Web Development, Agile Methodologies, and Model-Driven Engineering.
- 😎 Besides that, I'm passionate about music, sports, traveling, and enjoying life.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning more about Agile Methodologies and Coaching/Mentoring, and how they can help teams improve their day-to-day work. Also exploring the [OutSystems Platform](https://www.outsystems.com/) and some popular JavaScript frameworks like [Angular](https://angular.io/), [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/).
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on Agile Transformation, Model-Driven Development, and Web Development projects/research initiatives.
- 📫 Feel free to reach me through my [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andré-ribeiro-kr36) or my [email](mailto:andre.ribeiro88@outlook.pt).
